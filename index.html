                                <p class="news__text">Free directories: directories are perfect for customers that
                                    are... searching for a particular topic. What’s great about them is that you
                                    only
                                    have to post once and they are good for long periods of time. It saves a lot of
                                    your
                                    time when you don’t have to resubmit your information every week or every month.
                                    The
                                    bad news is most of your traffic won’t come from here. I still feel it is worth
                                    it
                                    to get your link out there. Just take one day and set it aside for posting to
                                    free
                                    directories. You won’t need to do it again for at least 6 months.

                                    2. Classified Ads: These are great for work from home businesses. Think about
                                    it.
                                    Where do people go when they are looking for a job? That’s right-the
                                    classifieds.
                                    The only downside to classified ads is that you have to resubmit them quite
                                    frequently. Once you find which classifieds bring you the most traffic you can
                                    concentrate on them and weed the others out. So it is really more time consuming
                                    in
                                    the beginning, and doesn’t have to be later on when you get the hang of things.

                                    3. Free article submissions/ezines: The best way to inform others about your
                                    product
                                    or service is to write an article about it. In your authors resource box, you
                                    can
                                    tell readers about yourself and where they can go to check out your product or
                                    service. This is also an excellent way to get free links to your site if you
                                    have
                                    one. There are a lot of webmasters out there who are looking for good articles
                                    they
                                    can post on their site. If they post yours, that is another site that is doing
                                    the
                                    advertising for you. All for free.

                                    4. URL Submissions: Probably the quickest and easiest thing to do to advertise
                                    your
                                    site. Just type “Free URL submission” in your search engine. When you get a list
                                    just enter the URL you are promoting and click submit. That’s it. It only takes
                                    a
                                    few seconds and your done. Just set a day aside once every 3 months and do this.

                                    5. Forum Posts: Put your product or service website in your signature file when
                                    you
                                    sign up on some forums. It will be displayed every time you make a post. Try to
                                    look
                                    for topics that you have some knowledge on, and can give a relevant answer too.
                                    Do
                                    not spam anyone, you will get kicked off the forum and you will get a bad
                                    reputation. Get involved asking and answering questions that pertain to your
                                    area of
                                    business. Forums are great because once you make a post it stays there forever.
                                    It
                                    will get moved to the archives eventually, but someone could still find it if
                                    they
                                    were searching the archives. Yes, there are many people who do.

                                    6. Traffic Exchanges: Probably the most time consuming way to advertise for
                                    free,
                                    but definately the most effective. Most forums I have visited have said in many
                                    posts that they received a lot of their profit from traffic exchanges. If you
                                    don’t
                                    want to spend the time surfing for credits, you do have the option of buying
                                    them. I
                                    would look into a program that lets you surf multiple websites at once like
                                    crazy
                                    browser. There are others and they are free to download. That way you can just
                                    spend
                                    one hour a day and get all your surfing in at once.

                                    7. News-groups: Become involved in a group that has to do with your kind of
                                    business. You can usually mail the group once per day, but I would encourage you

                                <p class="news__text">There are many things that are important to catalog design....
                                    Your images must be sharp and appealing. Your text and even the font you use for
                                    the
                                    text is important. The cover page design and the design of your catalog’s
                                    product
                                    pages all play important roles in designing a catalog that will bring in new
                                    customers and sales.

                                    However none of the things mentioned above are more important than the type of
                                    paper
                                    you will choose to print your catalog on. The “feel” of your catalog is
                                    important to
                                    your potential customers. The longer they have your catalog in their hands, the
                                    more
                                    product they will buy. In this article I will go over some of the many paper
                                    choices
                                    you have to print your catalog on.

                                    First you need to decide if the cover will be the same paper as the rest of your
                                    catalog. In most cases the cover will be of heavier weight then the interior
                                    pages.

                                    Second you will need to choose coated or uncoated paper for printing your
                                    catalog.
                                    Coated paper is for the glossier layouts and uncoated is more economical, but
                                    can
                                    still display your products well.

                                    So you have two things to consider first, “Will it be glossy paper or not?”,
                                    “Will
                                    my cover be the same weight as the interior pages of my catalog?”

                                    Once you have answered those two questions the next decision is what the weight
                                    of
                                    the paper will be. Most catalogs go with 60, 70, or 80 lb. weights. So it would
                                    be
                                    60lb uncoated or coated, 70 lb. Coated or uncoated. 80 lb. Paper usually is only
                                    chosen for 80 lb. Weight and above. Also, not all paper is measured by weight.
                                    Some
                                    is measured by thickness or “points”.

                                    Now the above is really over-simplified. There are other types of special paper
                                    you
                                    can choose from. There is textured paper, photographic paper, and other more
                                    expensive paper to choose from if you are selling a high-end or expensive
                                    product.

                                    There are also other considerations when choosing the paper your catalog will be
                                    printed on. Such as the method of printing you are going to choose.

                                    If you are going to have your catalog printed on a hot-set web press, then you
                                    can
                                    choose uncoated or coated paper. The heat will dry the ink as it prints your
                                    catalog. If your printer uses a cold-set web press then the ink air-dries and is
                                    absorbed into the paper. A cold-set web press cannot print on coated paper.

                                    If your printer uses a sheet-fed press then you can choose from any of the high
                                    quality papers they have available. The same goes for printers that do digital
                                    printing.

                                    It will depend a lot on the printer you choose. You need to find out what type
                                    of
                                    paper is available and you will want to see samples of the paper to get a better
                                    idea of which one you want to print your catalog on. Also ask your printer to
                                    suggest the different types of paper they think will be the best for your
                                    catalog.

                                    Here is a list of some of the types of paper your printer may have available for
                                    you
                                    to choose from or may be able to order for you.

                                    Dull Coated Paper

                                    Matte Coated Paper

                                    Glossy Coated Paper

                                    Antique Paper

                                    Vellum Paper

                                    Wove Paper

                                    Smooth Paper

                                    Felt Paper

                                    Linen Paper

                                    Fiber-added Paper

                                    Laid Paper

                                    Parchment

                                    Four things determine the quality of the paper, opacity, brightness, finish, and
                                    ppi. (Pounds per inch) Brightness affects the contrast and brilliance of the
                                    paper.
                                    It affects how your text will stand out on the pages of your catalog. Opacity is
                                    how
                                    much your ink is visible from the back of the page. If a paper is too opaque,
                                    your
                                    text and images from one page will be seen through onto another page that your
                                    customer is trying to read. The finish affects the feel of the pages and also
                                    how
                                    your images will look. The lower grade finishes produce grainier images while
                                    high
                                    quality finishes sharpen the look of your images.

                                    Ask your printer to provide you with samples or swatch booklets and a price list
                                    for
                                    printing your catalog on the various types of paper before you decide. You know
                                    what
                                    your budget is and paper is only one of the expenses you have to consider.</p>

                                <p class="news__text">There are many things that are important to catalog design....
                                    Your images must be sharp and appealing. Your text and even the font you use for
                                    the
                                    text is important. The cover page design and the design of your catalog’s
                                    product
                                    pages all play important roles in designing a catalog that will bring in new
                                    customers and sales.

                                    However none of the things mentioned above are more important than the type of
                                    paper
                                    you will choose to print your catalog on. The “feel” of your catalog is
                                    important to
                                    your potential customers. The longer they have your catalog in their hands, the
                                    more
                                    product they will buy. In this article I will go over some of the many paper
                                    choices
                                    you have to print your catalog on.

                                    First you need to decide if the cover will be the same paper as the rest of your
                                    catalog. In most cases the cover will be of heavier weight then the interior
                                    pages.

                                    Second you will need to choose coated or uncoated paper for printing your
                                    catalog.
                                    Coated paper is for the glossier layouts and uncoated is more economical, but
                                    can
                                    still display your products well.

                                    So you have two things to consider first, “Will it be glossy paper or not?”,
                                    “Will
                                    my cover be the same weight as the interior pages of my catalog?”

                                    Once you have answered those two questions the next decision is what the weight
                                    of
                                    the paper will be. Most catalogs go with 60, 70, or 80 lb. weights. So it would
                                    be
                                    60lb uncoated or coated, 70 lb. Coated or uncoated. 80 lb. Paper usually is only
                                    chosen for 80 lb. Weight and above. Also, not all paper is measured by weight.
                                    Some
                                    is measured by thickness or “points”.

                                    Now the above is really over-simplified. There are other types of special paper
                                    you
                                    can choose from. There is textured paper, photographic paper, and other more
                                    expensive paper to choose from if you are selling a high-end or expensive
                                    product.

                                    There are also other considerations when choosing the paper your catalog will be
                                    printed on. Such as the method of printing you are going to choose.

                                    If you are going to have your catalog printed on a hot-set web press, then you
                                    can
                                    choose uncoated or coated paper. The heat will dry the ink as it prints your
                                    catalog. If your printer uses a cold-set web press then the ink air-dries and is
                                    absorbed into the paper. A cold-set web press cannot print on coated paper.

                                    If your printer uses a sheet-fed press then you can choose from any of the high
                                    quality papers they have available. The same goes for printers that do digital
                                    printing.

                                    It will depend a lot on the printer you choose. You need to find out what type
                                    of
                                    paper is available and you will want to see samples of the paper to get a better
                                    idea of which one you want to print your catalog on. Also ask your printer to
                                    suggest the different types of paper they think will be the best for your
                                    catalog.

                                    Here is a list of some of the types of paper your printer may have available for
                                    you
                                    to choose from or may be able to order for you.

                                    Dull Coated Paper

                                    Matte Coated Paper

                                    Glossy Coated Paper

                                    Antique Paper

                                    Vellum Paper

                                    Wove Paper

                                    Smooth Paper

                                    Felt Paper

                                    Linen Paper

                                    Fiber-added Paper

                                    Laid Paper

                                    Parchment

                                    Four things determine the quality of the paper, opacity, brightness, finish, and
                                    ppi. (Pounds per inch) Brightness affects the contrast and brilliance of the
                                    paper.
                                    It affects how your text will stand out on the pages of your catalog. Opacity is
                                    how
                                    much your ink is visible from the back of the page. If a paper is too opaque,
                                    your
                                    text and images from one page will be seen through onto another page that your
                                    customer is trying to read. The finish affects the feel of the pages and also
                                    how
                                    your images will look. The lower grade finishes produce grainier images while
                                    high
                                    quality finishes sharpen the look of your images.

                                    Ask your printer to provide you with samples or swatch booklets and a price list
                                    for
                                    printing your catalog on the various types of paper before you decide. You know
                                    what
                                    your budget is and paper is only one of the expenses you have to consider.</p>

                                <p class="news__text">Free directories: directories are perfect for customers that
                                    are... searching for a particular topic. What’s great about them is that you
                                    only
                                    have to post once and they are good for long periods of time. It saves a lot of
                                    your
                                    time when you don’t have to resubmit your information every week or every month.
                                    The
                                    bad news is most of your traffic won’t come from here. I still feel it is worth
                                    it
                                    to get your link out there. Just take one day and set it aside for posting to
                                    free
                                    directories. You won’t need to do it again for at least 6 months.

                                    2. Classified Ads: These are great for work from home businesses. Think about
                                    it.
                                    Where do people go when they are looking for a job? That’s right-the
                                    classifieds.
                                    The only downside to classified ads is that you have to resubmit them quite
                                    frequently. Once you find which classifieds bring you the most traffic you can
                                    concentrate on them and weed the others out. So it is really more time consuming
                                    in
                                    the beginning, and doesn’t have to be later on when you get the hang of things.

                                    3. Free article submissions/ezines: The best way to inform others about your
                                    product
                                    or service is to write an article about it. In your authors resource box, you
                                    can
                                    tell readers about yourself and where they can go to check out your product or
                                    service. This is also an excellent way to get free links to your site if you
                                    have
                                    one. There are a lot of webmasters out there who are looking for good articles
                                    they
                                    can post on their site. If they post yours, that is another site that is doing
                                    the
                                    advertising for you. All for free.

                                    4. URL Submissions: Probably the quickest and easiest thing to do to advertise
                                    your
                                    site. Just type “Free URL submission” in your search engine. When you get a list
                                    just enter the URL you are promoting and click submit. That’s it. It only takes
                                    a
                                    few seconds and your done. Just set a day aside once every 3 months and do this.

                                    5. Forum Posts: Put your product or service website in your signature file when
                                    you
                                    sign up on some forums. It will be displayed every time you make a post. Try to
                                    look
                                    for topics that you have some knowledge on, and can give a relevant answer too.
                                    Do
                                    not spam anyone, you will get kicked off the forum and you will get a bad
                                    reputation. Get involved asking and answering questions that pertain to your
                                    area of
                                    business. Forums are great because once you make a post it stays there forever.
                                    It
                                    will get moved to the archives eventually, but someone could still find it if
                                    they
                                    were searching the archives. Yes, there are many people who do.

                                    6. Traffic Exchanges: Probably the most time consuming way to advertise for
                                    free,
                                    but definately the most effective. Most forums I have visited have said in many
                                    posts that they received a lot of their profit from traffic exchanges. If you
                                    don’t
                                    want to spend the time surfing for credits, you do have the option of buying
                                    them. I
                                    would look into a program that lets you surf multiple websites at once like
                                    crazy
                                    browser. There are others and they are free to download. That way you can just
                                    spend
                                    one hour a day and get all your surfing in at once.

                                    7. News-groups: Become involved in a group that has to do with your kind of
                                    business. You can usually mail the group once per day, but I would encourage you
                                    to
                                    find something fresh to talk about each day. People will tune you out if they
                                    see
                                    the same message all the time. Remember to never Spam anyone. Only join groups
                                    with
                                    the same interests as yours. In other words, don’t sign up for a recipe swapping
                                    group when you are advertising shaving cream.</p>

                                <p class="news__text">Free directories: directories are perfect for customers that
                                    are... searching for a particular topic. What’s great about them is that you
                                    only
                                    have to post once and they are good for long periods of time. It saves a lot of
                                    your
                                    time when you don’t have to resubmit your information every week or every month.
                                    The
                                    bad news is most of your traffic won’t come from here. I still feel it is worth
                                    it
                                    to get your link out there. Just take one day and set it aside for posting to
                                    free
                                    directories. You won’t need to do it again for at least 6 months.

                                    2. Classified Ads: These are great for work from home businesses. Think about
                                    it.
                                    Where do people go when they are looking for a job? That’s right-the
                                    classifieds.
                                    The only downside to classified ads is that you have to resubmit them quite
                                    frequently. Once you find which classifieds bring you the most traffic you can
                                    concentrate on them and weed the others out. So it is really more time consuming
                                    in
                                    the beginning, and doesn’t have to be later on when you get the hang of things.

                                    3. Free article submissions/ezines: The best way to inform others about your
                                    product
                                    or service is to write an article about it. In your authors resource box, you
                                    can
                                    tell readers about yourself and where they can go to check out your product or
                                    service. This is also an excellent way to get free links to your site if you
                                    have
                                    one. There are a lot of webmasters out there who are looking for good articles
                                    they
                                    can post on their site. If they post yours, that is another site that is doing
                                    the
                                    advertising for you. All for free.

                                    4. URL Submissions: Probably the quickest and easiest thing to do to advertise
                                    your
                                    site. Just type “Free URL submission” in your search engine. When you get a list
                                    just enter the URL you are promoting and click submit. That’s it. It only takes
                                    a
                                    few seconds and your done. Just set a day aside once every 3 months and do this.

                                    5. Forum Posts: Put your product or service website in your signature file when
                                    you
                                    sign up on some forums. It will be displayed every time you make a post. Try to
                                    look
                                    for topics that you have some knowledge on, and can give a relevant answer too.
                                    Do
                                    not spam anyone, you will get kicked off the forum and you will get a bad
                                    reputation. Get involved asking and answering questions that pertain to your
                                    area of
                                    business. Forums are great because once you make a post it stays there forever.
                                    It
                                    will get moved to the archives eventually, but someone could still find it if
                                    they
                                    were searching the archives. Yes, there are many people who do.

                                    but definately the most effective. Most forums I have visited have said in many
                                    posts that they received a lot of their profit from traffic exchanges. If you
                                    don’t
                                    want to spend the time surfing for credits, you do have the option of buying
                                    them. I
                                    would look into a program that lets you surf multiple websites at once like
                                    crazy
